LongTermEvolution Hierarchy

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.LongTermEvolution
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}


Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all LongTermEvolution configuration properties.

		void SetProperty(string property, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as readwrite are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InProgress
					 [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.Failed

Signals		PropertyChanged(string property, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	string DefaultAccessPointName [readwrite]

			On LongTermEvolution, contexts activate automatically.
			This property allows selection of an APN to be used on
			next automatic activation.

			Setting this property to an empty string clears the
			default APN from the modem.

		string Protocol [readwrite, experimental]

			Holds the protocol for this context.  Valid values
			are: "ip", "ipv6" and "dual". Default value is "ip".

		string AuthenticationMethod [readwrite, experimental]

			Sets the Method used for the authentication
			for the default APN.

			Available values are "none", "pap" and "chap".
			Default is "none".

			If the AuthenticationMethod is set to 'none',
			no authentication is performed for the default attach
			APN.  Username and Password properties are ignored,
			even if containing a valid value.  If Username or
			Password are empty, AuthenticationMethod is implicitly
			assumed to be set to 'none'.

			If the default APN supports authentication and it
			fails, then it is up to the network how to proceed.
			In general LTE access is denied and the modem can
			fallback to a legacy technology if capable and another
			radio technology is available.

		string Username [readwrite, experimental]

			Holds the username to be used for authentication
			purposes.

		string Password [readwrite, experimental]

			Holds the password to be used for authentication
			purposes.
