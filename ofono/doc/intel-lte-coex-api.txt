LTE Coexistence hierarchy
=========================

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.intel.LteCoexistence
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all coexistence configuration properties.

		void SetProperty(string property, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as Read-write are changeable.
			On success a PropertyChanged signal will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InProgress
						[service].Error.InvalidArguments
						[service].Error.Failed

		void RegisterAgent(object path)

			Registers an agent which will be called whenever the
			modem initiates LTE Coexistence information.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InProgress
					 [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.InvalidFormat
					 [service].Error.Failed

		void UnregisterAgent(object path)

			Unregisters an agent.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.Failed

		a(a{sv}) GetPlmnHistory()
			Requests for LTE Plmn history list stored in NVM to
			retrieve geo location history like MobileNetworkCode,
			MobileCountryCode, LteBandsFDD, LteBandsTDD,
			ChannelBandwidth.

			Refer to the sections below for which property types
			are available, their valid value ranges and
			applicability to different cell types.

Signals		PropertyChanged(string property, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	string Band [readwrite]

			Frequency band in which the modem is operating when
			using "lte" mode.

		boolean BTActive [readwrite]

			Contains whether BT Coex is activated or not.

		boolean WLANActive [readwrite]

			Contains whether WLAN Coex is activated or not.

		string WLANBandwidth [readwrite]

			Contains the frequency WLAN Coex is activated on, when
			"CoexWLANActive" is active.

			The possible values are:
			- "20MHz"
			- "40MHz"
			- "80MHz"

LTECoexistenceAgent Hierarchy [experimental]
=============================

Service		unique name
Interface	org.ofono.intel.LteCoexistenceAgent
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void ReceiveBluetoothNotification(array{byte} notification,
							dict info) [noreply]

			Requests the agent to process Bluetooth related LTE
			Coexistence information. The dictionary info contains
			vector table with modem recommended Safe Tx/Rx band and
			range information.The properties involved are
			'SafeTxMin', 'SafeRxMin', 'SafeTxMax', 'SafeRxMax' and
			'SafeVector'.

			Possible Errors: None

		void ReceiveWiFiNotification(array{byte} notification,
							dict info) [noreply]

			Requests the agent to process WiFi related LTE
			Coexistence information. The dictionary info contains
			vector table with modem recommended SafeTx/Rx band and
			range information. The properties involved are
			'SafeTxMin', 'SafeRxMin', 'SafeTxMax', 'SafeRxMax' and
			'SafeVector'.

			Possible Errors: None

		void Release() [noreply]

			Agent is being released, possibly because of oFono
			terminating, Coex interface is being torn down or modem
			off. No UnregisterAgent call is needed.

LTE Plmn history params
=======================
uint16 MobileNetworkCode [readonly, optional]

	Contains the MNC of the cell.

uint16 MobileCountryCode [readonly, optional]

	Contains the Lte TDD band. Valid range of values is 33 to 64 as per
	3GPP 36.101 Section 5.5.

byte ChannelBandwidth [readonly, optional]

	Contains the Channel bandwidth. Valid range of values is 0 to 6 as per
	3GPP 36.101 Section 5.6.
